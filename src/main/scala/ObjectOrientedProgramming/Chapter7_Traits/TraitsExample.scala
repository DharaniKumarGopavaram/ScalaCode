package ObjectOrientedProgramming.Chapter7_Traits

/*
  traits are similar to interfaces in Java
  traits are same like abstract classes but they can not have constructor arguments until scala 2 in Scala 3 we can have constructor arguments for trait
  traits can not be instantiated
  A class can extend only one class whereas it can mix in any number of traits
  Scala will follow linearization to overcome the diamond problem of multiple inheritance
